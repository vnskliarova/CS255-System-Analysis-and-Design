# CS255-System-Analysis-and-Design


DriverPass is a company asking for a new system that will help them to take advantage of the void in the market when it comes to training students for the driving test at their local department of motor vehicles (DMV).

I think I did a decent job of listening to the client’s needs, compiling the list of requirements, and putting together a use-case diagram based on those requirements. The part I would improve on is the non-functional requirements. They require solid knowledge in many different areas, and a good amount of research for each particular project, so if I were to improve any part, I’d zoom in on the non-functional requirements.

To interpret the user’s needs and implement them into the system design, I analyzed the client’s requests that were voiced over during the interview. Based on that, I put together a list of requirements and designed the needed diagrams. It is important to consider users’ needs when designing because if we don’t - we’re creating some app for fun, not for the client. We can design a great system, but if it’s not what the client asked for - it’s useless.

I would approach it in an iterative manner, always going back to the client and the technical team to iron out the details, making sure everyone is on the same page, and the client is happy. I think good techniques to utilize are interviews with the client, JAD sessions, UML diagrams that would keep a lot of information organized, and keeping detailed documentation.
